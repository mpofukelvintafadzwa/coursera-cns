# Week 2 - Neural Encoding - Task Description

This week's content concerned models of neural encoding. Specifically, using a neuron's Spike-Triggered Average (STA) to try to understand the features within the stimulus that prompted this neuron's response. 

Using a provided dataset of spikes collected from a motion-senstive neuron in a fly, a Python script was built to compute the neuron's STA.

The script outputs a plot of the fly's STA, which can be seen in the 'plots' folder. Based on the plot, I was able to conclude that spikes were most reliably observed through constant postive stimuli.
