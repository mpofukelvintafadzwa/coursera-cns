This week's content concerned models of neural encoding. Specifically, using a neuron's Spike-Triggered Average (STA) to try to understand the features within the stimulus that prompted this neuron's response. 

Using a provided dataset of spikes from a motio-senstive neuron of a fly, the fly's STA was computed by writing a Python script.

The script outputs a plot of the fly's STA, which can be seen in the 'plots' folder.
