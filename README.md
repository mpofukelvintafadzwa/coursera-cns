# Coursera-CNS
Course notes and assignments for Coursera's Computational Neuroscience course. It is quite a challenging (yet fascinating) 8 week course taught by professors from the University of Washington. Weekly problem sets are coded in python. PDF notes are annotated with stickies, accessible by opening file in Adobe Reader. Expected graduation with certificate June 2018.

## Motivation
These days neural nets are used everywhere, but few people that implement them, including myself, understand the _scientific basis_ behind them. I'm taking this course in an attempt to better understand neural network architecture from a biological perspective, by studying the mechanisms they attempt to simulate computationally.
