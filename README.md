# Coursera-CNS
Course notes and assignments for Coursera's Computational Neuroscience course. It is quite a challenging (yet fascinating) 8 week course taught by professors from the University of Washington.

Weekly problem sets are coded in python. PDF notes are annotated with stickies, accessible by opening file in Adobe Reader. 

Expected graduation with certificate early May 2018.
